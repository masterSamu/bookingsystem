My client has an online shop and she received a lot of booking requests for products from customers via email or Facebook. She needed a system to store those bookings.
Application merge information from Product, Customer, Supplier and Booking to easy user interface. There is own pages for each parts where you can manage informations.
At the bookings page it is easy to filter bookings by searching with product, customer or supplier information.
